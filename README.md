# Apartment-Management-System
----------------------------------
This Apartment-Management System program was created to assist landlords to be able to track down their records digitally. 
They will be able to interact with tables of records:
- the Tenant List
- the Rental Income Record
- the Expense Record
and will be able to view their earnings through the Annual Summary page. 

With so many things to manage as a property owner or landlord, this system allows for a clearer and more concise system of governing tasks. This assists its user in keeping maintenance over financial documents and tenant records.
